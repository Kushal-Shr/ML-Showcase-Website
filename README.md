# Machine Learning Project Showcase
## Overview
Welcome to Machine Learning Project Showcase project! This project is react website used to showcase three of my ML models which are deployed using streamlit. This Project includes a Diabetes Predictor, Mail Classifier, and a Sales Predictor. I used react js, HTML, and CSS in order to make the frontend of the project and I used Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn, and Streamlit for the Machine Learning Models.
